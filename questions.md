1. What cell types did you identify at the different stages of infection?

Across mock, 1 dpi, 2 dpi, and 3 dpi, I identified the major airway epithelial populations: Club, Basal, BC/club intermediates, Ciliated, and Goblet cells. These populations were consistently detected across conditions and matched the known cell types of the bronchial epithelium. At 3 dpi, Club and BC/club cells became the dominant populations, while Basal and Ciliated cells showed shifts consistent with epithelial remodeling under infection.

2. Why do these cell types correlate with COVID-19 infection?

SARS-CoV-2 directly infects airway epithelial cells, so these cell types reflect the natural biology of infection. Ciliated cells are primary viral targets, Club cells participate in both susceptibility and epithelial repair, Basal cells act as progenitors activated during tissue damage, Goblet cells change under inflammatory stimulus, and BC/club cells emerge during regeneration. Their proportions and transcriptional profiles therefore correlate with COVID-19 pathology.

3. Is ACE2 a good marker for tracking COVID-19 infection in this dataset?

No. ACE2 expression is extremely low and sparse in this dataset and does not overlap with infected or high–viral RNA cells. Although ACE2 is the viral entry receptor, its transcript levels do not reflect infection burden. SARS-CoV-2 spreads beyond ACE2-positive cells, making ACE2 unsuitable as an infection-rate marker in this scRNA-seq dataset.

4. What is the difference between ENO2 and ACE2 as biomarkers?

ACE2 is a viral entry receptor with low detectable expression in scRNA-seq data and does not indicate the extent of infection. ENO2, however, is upregulated in response to viral stress and correlates with infection-induced cellular changes. Therefore, ENO2 is a functional infection-response biomarker, while ACE2 reflects only potential viral entry.

5. Which cell cluster shows the highest ACE2 abundance at 3 dpi, and what does this mean biologically?

Cluster 7 had the highest ACE2 expression at 3 dpi and corresponded to Club cells. This suggests Club cells may represent a population with increased entry receptor expression. However, ACE2 expression remains low overall and does not correlate with viral positivity, indicating that ACE2 alone does not explain infection spread. Thus, even though this cluster has the highest ACE2 level, ACE2 is not a reliable indicator of infection status in this dataset.
